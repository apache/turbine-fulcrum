     This Service functions as a Global Cache.  A global cache is a good
     place to store items that you may need to access often but don't
     necessarily need (or want) to fetch from the database everytime.  A
     good example would be a look up table of States that you store in a
     database and use throughout your application.  Since information
     about States doesn't change very often, you could store this
     information in the Global Cache and decrease the overhead of
     hitting the database everytime you need State information.

      It is written 
      for use in Turbine but it can be used in any container compatible 
      with Avalon's ECM container.
