            <p>
                The MimeType Service maintains mappings between MIME types and
                the corresponding file name extensions (extremely useful in
                conjunction with file upload), and between locales and character
                encodings. The mappings are dependent upon the implementation,
                and are typically defined in properties or files located in
                user's home directory, Java home directory, or the current
                class's JAR.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is written
                for use in Turbine but it can be used in any container compatible
                with Avalon's ECM container.

        <section name="Usage">

            <p>
                The default RunData implementation uses the MimeType Service internally
                when resolving the character encoding of the servlet response. In addition,
                applications can use it for customized encoding and content type resolving.
            </p>

            <p>
                The mappings between locales and the corresponding character encodings
                are specified using the Java property file syntax, where the locale
                specification is the key of the property key and the charset is the value
                of the property. The locale specification consists of three parts:
            </p>

            <source><![CDATA[
    <lang>_<country>_<variant>
            ]]></source>

            <p>
                The variant can be whatever is appropriate for the application, like a
                markup language specification, a browser specification, etc. The service
                looks for charsets using the following search order:
            </p>

            <source><![CDATA[
    <lang>_<country>_<variant>=<charset>
    _<country>_<variant>=<charset>
    <lang>__<variant>=<charset>
    __<variant>=<charset>
    <lang>_<country>=<charset>
    _<country>=<charset>
    <lang>=<charset>
            ]]></source>

            <p>
                The service contains defaults for several language mappings and more
                specific ones can be specified in an optional property file, e.g. 
                __wml=UTF-8. The name of the property file can be given with a service
                property named "charsets".
                The service caches results of the search, which should guarantee good
                performance.
            </p>

            <p>
                The mappings between MIME types and the corresponding file name
                extensions are specified using the same syntax as the mime.types file
                of the Apache Server, i.e.:
            </p>

            <source><![CDATA[
    <mimetype> <ext1> <ext2>...
            ]]></source>

            <p>
                The service contains defaults for most common MIME types, like
                text/plain, text/html, text/x-hdml, text/vnd.wap.wml, image/gif and 
                image/jpeg. More specific ones can be specified in an optional MIME types
                file. The name of the MIME types file can be given with a service property
                named "mimetypes".
