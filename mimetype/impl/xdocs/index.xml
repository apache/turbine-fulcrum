    <p>
      The MimeType Service maintains mappings between MIME types and
      the corresponding file name extensions, and between locales and
      character encodings. The mappings are typically defined in
      properties or files located in user's home directory, Java home
      directory or the current class jar depending on the implementation.
   </p>
      
    <p>
      It is written 
      for use in Turbine but it can be used in any container compatible 
      with Avalon's ECM container.

      First, here is the role configuration.
    </p>

<![CDATA[
    <role
        name="org.apache.fulcrum.mimetype.MimeTypeService"
        shorthand="mimetype"
        default-class="org.apache.fulcrum.mimetype.DefaultMimeTypeService"/>
]]>

    And here is the configuration:

  <section name="Usage">

<p>
The default RunData implementation uses the MimeType Service internally
when resolving the character encoding of the servlet response. In addition,
applications can use it for customized encoding and content type resolving.
</p>

<p>
The mappings between locales and the corresponding character encodings
are specified using the Java property file syntax, where the locale
specification is the key of the property key and the charset is the value
of the property. The locale specification consists of three parts:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
<lang>_<country>_<variant>
]]></source>

<p>
The variant can be whatever is appropriate for the application, like a
markup language specification, a browser specification, etc. The service
looks for charsets using the following search order:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
<lang>_<country>_<variant>=<charset>
_<country>_<variant>=<charset>
<lang>__<variant>=<charset>
__<variant>=<charset>
<lang>_<country>=<charset>
_<country>=<charset>
<lang>=<charset>
]]></source>

<p>
The service contains defaults for several language mappings and more specific
ones can be specified in an optional property file, e.g. __wml=UTF-8. The name
of the property file can be given with a service property named "charsets".
The service caches results of the search, which should guarantee good performance.
</p>

<p>
The mappings between MIME types and the corresponding file name extensions
are specified using the same syntax as the mime.types file of the Apache Server,
i.e.:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
<mimetype> <ext1> <ext2>...
]]></source>

<p>
The service contains defaults for most common MIME types, like text/plain,
text/html, text/x-hdml, text/vnd.wap.wml, image/gif and image/jpeg. More
specific ones can be specified in an optional MIME types file. The name of
the MIME types file can be given with a service property named "mime.types".
</p>

<p>
The TurbineMimeTypes class is a static accessor for the most common
MimeType Service methods.
