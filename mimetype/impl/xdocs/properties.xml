             This property specifies a file containing mappings between MIME 
             content types and the corresponding file name extensions. The
             service itself contains a hardcoded set of most common mappings. 
            The file must use the same syntax as the mime.types file of 
            the Apache Server, i.e. 
            [mimetype] [ext1] [ext2]...  
            <p/>
            For example /WEB-INF/conf/mime.types
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>charsets</td>
          <td>Yes</td>
          <td>
            This property specifies a file containing mappings between locales 
            and the corresponding character encodings. The service itself 
            contains a hardcoded set of most common mappings. 
            The file should use the Java property file syntax, i.e. 
            lang_country_variant=charset
            <p/>
            For example /WEB-INF/conf/charset.properties
          </td>
        </tr>
