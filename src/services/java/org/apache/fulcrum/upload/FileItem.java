 *
 * <p> After retrieving an instance of this class from the {@link
 * org.apache.fulcrum.util.parser.ParameterParser ParameterParser} (see
 * {@link org.apache.fulcrum.util.parser.ParameterParser#getFileItem(String)
 * ParameterParser.getFileItem(String)} and {@link
 * org.apache.fulcrum.util.parser.ParameterParser#getFileItems(String)
 * ParameterParser.getFileItems(String)}) you can use it to acces the

 * java.io.InputStream InputStream} with {@link #getStream()} and
 * process the file without attempting to load it into memory, which
 * may come handy with large files.
 *
 * Implements the javax.activation.DataSource interface (which allows
 * for example the adding of a FileItem as an attachment to a multipart
 * email).
