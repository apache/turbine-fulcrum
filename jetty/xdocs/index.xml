    <section name="Overview">
      <p>
        The Fulcrum Jetty Service allows embedding a Jetty HTTP server to serve
        HTTP request. The main focus is to add HTTP support to an existing
        non-web application, e.g. for exposing web services. The tests also
        exercise JSPs and JAAS integration to make sure that everything is properly wired.
      </p>

    <section name="How to Test Manually">
      <p>
        To make sure that Jetty is properly integrated run the following command line
      </p>  
      <source><![CDATA[
mvn -Pstandalone test
      ]]></source>
      <p>
        This will start the embedded Jetty and allows manual testing using
        <a href="http://localhost:9080/test/">http://localhost:9080/test/</a>.

      <p>
        The fulcrum-jetty library ships with optional JSP support because
        <ul>
          <li>most people plainly don't need it and it adds a lot of baggage</li>
          <li>for supporting JDK 1.4 and 1.5 different libraries are required</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <subsection name="JSP 2.1 Support for JDK 1.5">
        <p>
          These dependencies are required for running JSP 2.1 on JDK 1.5
