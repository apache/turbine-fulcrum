        This service breaks the singleton addiction when acessing
        an Avalon container created somewhere else in the application.
        The implementation stores the instance of a service manager 
        and allows access to this instance and related information such as
        <ul>
          <li>the Avalon logger of the service</li>
          <li>the Avalon ServiceManager instance to lookup services</li>
          <li>the Avalon Context instance of the container</li>
          <li>the Avalon Configuration instance of the service</li>
          <li>the Avalon Parameters instance of the container</li>
       </ul>
