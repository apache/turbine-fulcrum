      <subsection name="Complexity">
        <p>
          Your first impression might be that the implementation is
          overly complicated - and yes, you are right. On the other
          hand sending emails is our core business and we regularly
          have to do the following things
          <ul>
            <li>Signing emails and/or attachment with X.509 certificates</li>
            <li>Figuring out why sending en email goes wrong</li>
            <li>
              Archving the emails being sent using the file system, database or commercial archiving systems
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Domain Centric Approach">
        <p>
          The configuration of the services is centered around domains whereas
          a domain usually maps to the mail address of the sender. A domain
          contains all relevant configuration information for the email being
          created or sent.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Application Hooks">
        <p>
          The service provide methods which can be overriden by a derived class.
          Since the author has no idea about the required configuration needed by
          a derived class the CommonsEmailDomainEntry allows access to the
          corresponding configuration instance.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Determining a Domain">
        <p>
          The domain is determined using the following steps
          <ul>
            <li>take the domain matching the sender's email address (e.g. foo@bar.com)</li>
            <li>take the domain matching the sender's domain address (e.g. bar.com)</li>
            <li>take the default domain</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
