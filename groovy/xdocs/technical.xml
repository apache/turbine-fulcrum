    <section name="Multi-threaded Groovy?">

      <p>
        Currently the implementation of groovy.lang.Script keeps the binding
        (= the parameters you pass to the script) as a member variable. One
        could call it a feature ... :-(
      </p>

      <p>
        Running a script with two threads would overwrite the
        parameters passed to the script. Therefore the Groovy Service
        uses semaphore to enforce the single-threaded execution of
        a Groovy script. This still allows executing different scipts
        in parallel with multiple threads.
      </p>

    <section name="Locator">

      <p>
        The locator gives you easy customization of Groovy scripts. Let's
        say you would like to invoke the script 'magic.groovy' for a customer
        'ABC' and 'XYZ' using the following script layout
      </p>

      <source>
        <![CDATA[
scripts
  -- magic.groovy
  -- ABC
     -- magic.groovy
        ]]>
      </source>

      <p>
        In the case of invoking 'ABC/magic.groovy' the script 'ABC/magic.groovy' would be executed.
        In the case of invoking 'XYZ/magic.groovy' the locator is looking for 'XYZ/magic.groovy'. Since
        it isn't found it steps up a directory to execute 'magic.groovy'. The trick was taken from
        the Fulcrum XSLT service which uses a simlilar fallback mechanism.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section name="Script Management">
      <p>
        The Groovy scripts are managesd by the Fulcrum ResourcManager Service. In the
        future this might allow to store the Groovy Scripts in a database.
      </p>

    <section name="Why not using BSF">
      <p>
        At the time of coding I was pretty ignorant regarding BSF (in the meantime I know better).
        Having said that BSF does not add a lot of value for the moment and a BSF-free service allows
        tinkering with the more advanced features of Groovy.
