    <release version="1.0-alpha-2" date="in SVN">
     <action dev="seade" type="fix" issue="FULS10">
        TemplateEmail.sendMultiple() was setting the character set to late.
     </action>
     <action dev="sgoeschl" type="update">
        Changed the signature of TemplateHtmlEmail.send() since it inherits
        from Mail.send(). The method now throws an EmailException instead
        of MessagingException which might break existing code.
      </action>
     <action dev="sgoeschl" type="update">
        Upgrading to javamail-1.3.2 and commons-email-1.0
      </action>
     <action dev="epugh" type="add">
        Fix EmailTemplate and HtmlEmailTemplate by providing a templateService
        that can be manually passed in.  Should be avalon components instead.
      </action>
     <action dev="epugh" type="remove">
        Remove facade class, this is implementation specific.
      </action>
     <action dev="epugh" type="add">
        Initial conversion to Avalon component.
