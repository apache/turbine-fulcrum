        Changed the name of the component app root to "componentAppRoot" from
        "ComponentAppRoot".  This matches what Turbine uses.  Really, this should
        be a configurable thing, not a hardcoded context value.

      <action dev="epugh" type="add">
        TestContainer can accept either the split role.xml, config.xml
        or just a single combined xml file.  Additionally, by lazy loading
        the container, you can swap between container configurations in
        the various unit tests.
      </action>
      <action dev="quintonm" type="add">
        TestContainer component was added.  This is to be used for 
        testing of the components so that we do not have a dependancy
        on Plexus.  The test container is based on ECM, which is what
        Turbine is using.  A base class for unit tests is also included.
