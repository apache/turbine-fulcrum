Publishing Workflow

Prerequisites
 // jars
 mvn deploy -Papache-release
 // Stage the latest documentation 
 mvn site site:stage scm-publish:publish-scm -Dscmpublish.dryRun=true
 mvn clean site site:stage scm-publish:publish-scm -Dusername=<username> -Dpassword=<pw>

More Information

  http://maven.apache.org/developers/website/deploy-component-reference-documentation.html
  
Steps
1) Local Testing
  // Verify gpg.homedir, gpg.useagent, gpg.passphrase
  mvn clean site install -Papache-release -Dgpg.useagent=false -Dgpg.passphrase=<xx> 
  mvn release:prepare -DdryRun=true -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -Papache-release 

2) Remote Testing
  mvn release:clean
  mvn release:prepare -DautoVersionSubmodules=true -P apache-release -Dusername=<username> -Dpassword=<pw>
  // Helpful hint from Apache Website: If you're located in Europe then release:prepare may fail with 'Unable to tag SCM' and ' svn: No such revision X '. Wait 10 seconds and run mvn release:prepare again.
  
4) Release Preparing
