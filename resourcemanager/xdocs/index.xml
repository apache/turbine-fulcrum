    <section name="What is Fulcrum ResourceManager Service?">

      <p>
        The Fulcrum ResourceManager service handles the management of resources found
        in a domain whereas multiple domains can be defined. The current implementation 
        uses only the file system to store the resources of a domain. It should be possible 
        to come up with an implementation using a database to store the resources 
        centralized for a cluster.
      </p>

    <section name="What does it provide?">

      <p>
        The service provides the following features:        
        <ul>
          <li>automatic location of resources running up the directory tree</li>
          <li>management API for resources</li>
        </ul>
      </p>  
      
      <p>
        The key motiviation is reuse the automatic location of a resource since I
        implemented it a few times over the last two years. A couple services benefit
        from that behaviour, e.g. the fulcrum-dom4jxslt-service and fulcrum-groovy-service. 
        Using a context and traversing up the file system allows to invoke different 
        XSL file depending on the context. And the only thing to do is just to add 
        a XSL file in the appropriate directory and to overwrite one or more template 
        matching rules to customize the behaviour.

      <subsection name="A Locator Example">

          <source>
            <![CDATA[
scripts
  -- magic.groovy
  -- ABC
     -- magic.groovy
            ]]>
          </source>
    
          <p>
            In the case of invoking 'ABC/magic.groovy' the script 'ABC/magic.groovy' would be executed.
            In the case of invoking 'XYZ/magic.groovy' the locator is looking for 'XYZ/magic.groovy'. Since
            it isn't found it steps up a directory to execute 'magic.groovy'.

    <section name="What it does not provide?">      
      <p>      
        The service does not provided the following things
        <ul>
          <li>caching of the content of resources</li>
          <li>provision of virtual file systems</li>
        </ul>
      </p>  

      <p>
        I hate to implement any ad-hoc caching since this should be done by
        a proper cache manager such as JCS. BTW - the caching is quite often
        done by other services, e.g. a XSLT service caches the the compiled
        XSL files and not the file content.
      </p>
      
      <p> 
        And the virtual file system approach is beautiful but I don't need it.
