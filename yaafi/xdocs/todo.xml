      <subsection name="Using a Proxy">            
        <p>
          Currently the caller of a service uses the instance
          implementing the service interface directly. It would
          be useful to hand out a proxy object to delegate the 
          service invocation similiar to EJB and HiveMind.

      <subsection name="Long-term Compatibilty with Fortress">            
        <p>
          Since Fortress is the only other remaining Avalon container
          within Jakarta we try to achieve compatibility with Fortress
          regarding configuration files. The problem is that there is no
          specification available how the Fortress configuration files
          look like ... :-(

      <subsection name="Testing the cross-container portabilty">            
        <p>
          YAAFI actually maps the Avalon context depending on the container
          flavour of the service component. We still need to test this
          functionality with Fortress services.

      <subsection name="Use URLConnection for InputStreamLocator">            
        <p>
          Using a URLConnection enables downloading the configuration
          files from a HTTP server therefore allowing to run a set
          of application distributed over multiple boxes from a single
          configuration file.
