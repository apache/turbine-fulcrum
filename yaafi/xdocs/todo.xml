      <subsection name="Long-term Compatibilty with Fortress">            
        <p>
          Since Fortress is the only other remaining Avalon container
          within Jakarta we try to achieve compatibility with Fortress
          regarding configuration files. The problem is that there is no
          specification available how the Fortress configuration files
          look loke ... :-(

      <subsection name="Testing the cross-container portabilty">            
        <p>
          YAAFI actually maps the Avalon context depending on the container
          flavour of the service component. We still need to test this
          functionality with Fortress services.

      <subsection name="Use URLConnection for InputStreamLocator">            
        <p>
          Using a URLConnection enables downloading the configuration
          files from a HTTP server therefore allowing to run a set
          of application distributed over multiple boxes from a single
          configuration file.
