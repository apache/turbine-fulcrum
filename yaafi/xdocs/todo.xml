      <subsection name="Support for encrytped configuration files">
        <p>
          Encryption/decryption of role and component configuration file using 
          BlowfishJ from Markus Hahn (see http://www.lassekolb.info/bfacs.htm). 
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Adding a component personality">
        <p>
          Based on the component personality a proper Context will be 
          created (e.g. 'merlin', 'fortress', 'phoenix') and passed 
          to the component. This would allow to reuse Avalon service
          written for other containers (I'm not jokink)
        </p>

      <subsection name="Adding a container personality">
        <p>
          This would allow to embed YAAFI cleanly in another
          Avalon Container, e.g. within James.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Add automatic reconfiguration">
        <p>
          It would be nice to poll the configuration files
          and trigger a reconfiguration if they were changed
        </p>
