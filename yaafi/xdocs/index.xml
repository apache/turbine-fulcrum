	    This is the Yet Another Avalon Framework Implementation aka YAAFI.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The project was born out of the frustration to get Merlin to run. The service 
	    container is compatible to the existing framework implementation such as Excalibur
	    and Merlin since they rely on the Avalon service lifecycle.
