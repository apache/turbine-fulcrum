    <section name="What is the Fulcrum Script Service?">

      <p>
      	The Fulcrum Script Service provides an integration of the
      	JSR 223 specifiation to integrate scripting languages.
      	Basically this is the successor of the existing Fulcrum BSF
      	and Fulcrum Groovy service.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you are using JDK 1.5 then you need Bean Scripting
        Framework (bsf-api-3.0-beta2.jar). If you are using
        JDK 1.6 then the library will do no harm and you use
        the JDK 1.6 built-in implementation of JSR-223.
      </p>

      <subsection name="Features">
        <p>
          The Fulcrum Script Service provides the following features:
          <ul>
            <li>optional caching of scripts to improve performance</li>
            <li>optional script compilation depending on the scripting engine</li>
            <li>seamless integration with the existing Avalon infrastructure</li>
          </ul>
