You must have ant version 1.4 or newer installed.

Building the Fulcrum from CVS is now very easy.  Fulcrum has been
Maven-enabled.  Please refer to the Maven Getting Started document for
instructions on building.  This document is available here:

http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/maven/getting-started.html

Note: you'll also need to make sure you check out the jakarta-turbine-torque
repository because the current Fulcrum build uses templates in that
repository.  Both the jakarta-turbine-fulcrum and jakarta-turbnie-torque
repositories should be in the same top-level directory.
