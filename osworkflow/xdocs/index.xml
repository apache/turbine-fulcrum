  <section name="Overview">
    <p>
      The OSWorkflow component allows access to a workflow process
      based on the OpenSymphony OSWorkflow libary.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is written for use in any container compatible with Avalon's
      ECM container.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, here is the role configuration.
    </p>

<![CDATA[
  <role
    name="org.apache.fulcrum.osworkflow.WorkflowService"
    shorthand="workflow"
    default-class="org.apache.fulcrum.osworkflow.DefaultWorkflowService"/>
]]>
</source>

  <p>
    Configuration is currently not required as we use OSWorkflows
    defaults for finding everything right now.
