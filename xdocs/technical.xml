    <section name="The Implementation">
    
      <p>
        The Fulcrum ResourceManager Services manages multiple ResourceManager. Each ResourceManager 
        is responsible for exactly one domain. Therefore the Fulcrum ResourceManager Services just
        delegates the method invocations to the various ResourceManagers.
      </p>

      <subsection name="The Domain">
        <p>
          The resources are located in a domain. A domain definition contains the location of the 
          hierarchical resources, a suffix to filter resources based on their externsion and 
          a flag for using the locator feature
        </p>

        <p>
          It is not possible to define a domain more than once since each domain has a unique name. But it 
          is possible to use different domain names and share a location using a suffix filter.
        </p>
      </subsection>     

      <subsection name="The Context">
        <p>
          The context consist of a String[] and is used to locate a resource. The file system
          implementation iterates over the context and creates a relative file name
