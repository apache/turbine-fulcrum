      <p>
        Building Fulcrum from CVS is now very easy because it has been
        Maven-enabled.  Before you begin, you'll need to check out the
        <code>jakarta-turbine-fulcrum</code> CVS repository (if you are
        not familiar with the Jakarta CVS repositories, please refer to
        the <a href="/site/cvsindex.html">documentation</a>).  In
        addition, you'll also have to check out the
        <code>jakarta-turbine-torque</code> repository because the
        current build process references templates in that source
        directory.  Note: both repositories should be checked out in the
        same top-level directory.

        Please refer to the Maven <a
        href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/maven/getting-started.html">Getting
        Started</a> document for instructions on how to build the
        project using Maven.
