    <section name="Building Fulcrum">
      <p>
        Building Fulcrum from CVS is fairly straightforward.  have been
        made to the Fulcrum build process to simplify the acquisition of
        jar dependencies.  The entire build process is now a four-step
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first step of the process is to obtain the source.  Checkout
        the <code>jakarta-turbine-fulcrum</code> repository.  You'll
        also need to check out <code>jakarta-turbine-torque</code>
        because the current build process references templates in that
        source tree.  If you are unfamiliar with the Jakarta CVS
        repositories, please refer to the <a
          href="/site/cvsindex.html">CVS Repositories</a> document for
        assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, you must define the <code>lib.repo</code> property in
        your <code>${user.home}/build.properties</code> file.  If
        you do not have a <code>${user.home}/build.properties</code>
        file, create one in your home directory and add the
        following line:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
  lib.repo = /path/to/some/directory  
        ]]></source>
      <p> 
        The value of this property determines the location that the
        Fulcrum dependencies will be stored after they have been
        downloaded.  Note: this directory must exist in the
        filesystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, in the top-level directory of the Fulcrum distribution,
        type the following command to download all of the
        dependencies required to build Fulcrum:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
  ant update-jars  
        ]]></source>
      <p>
        Lastly, after all of the jars have been downloaded to your
        <code>lib.repo</code> directory, building the Fulcrum
        distribution is only a matter of verifying that the
        <code>torque.dir</code> property (defined in
        <code>jakarta-turbine-fulcrum/default.properties</code>) is set
        correctly, and typing the following command:
      </p>
      <source><![CDATA[
  ant
        ]]></source>
      <p>
        The resulting jar file will be located in the <code>bin</code>
        directory.  
      </p>
