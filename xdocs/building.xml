      <p>
        Building Fulcrum from CVS is now very easy because it has been
        Maven-enabled.  Before you begin, you'll need to check out the
        <code>jakarta-turbine-fulcrum</code> CVS repository (if you are
        not familiar with the Jakarta CVS repositories, please refer to
        the <a href="/site/cvsindex.html">documentation</a>).  
      </p>
      <p>
        Please refer to the Maven <a
        href="http://maven.apache.org/getting-started.html">Getting
        Started</a> document for instructions on how to install and
        use Maven.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the root directory of the fuklcrum project (where you checked
        out the code to or unpacked a source distribution), simply type 
        'maven' and press enter.  This will start a process that will
        build each component.  After the component is built, it will be 
        installed into you local maven repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build a local copy of the documentation, use 'mave site-all'.
        This will build a local copy of the web site in the 'target/docs' 
        directory.
