        Build process updated to use 'multiproject' plugin.  Additionally,
        significantly more components have been converted to being seperate
        Avalon components.

      <action dev="quintonm" type="add">
        The build process for Fulcrum has been changed.  Now, when you 
        build Fulcrum, it uses Maven's reactor to build the components
        individually.  This means that Fulcrum itself no longer has a 
        version number.  The individual components are versioned 
        seperately.  For changes to individual components, see the docs 
        for each component.
