      	Remove Intake Pull Tool.  It should I think be part of Turbine as it is
      	very Turbine specific right now.  I am trying to remove all Turbine requirements
      	for Intake.

      <action dev="epugh" type="add">
      	Added the Intake class which is a facade to the underlying IntakeService.

      <action dev="epugh" type="fix">
       The intake validators were fixed so that fields with required=false 
       rules no longer attempt to execute the remaining rules when no
       input is provided.  A minLength > 0 rule is no longer synonymous
       with required=true.  Patch originally supplied by Colin Chalmers
      </action>
      <action dev="seade" type="fix">
       Intake was fixed so that DateString will use the "formatn" (where n 
       &gt;= 1) rules to parse the input and then the "format" rule to format 
       it (the "format" rule is also used to parse the date if there are no
       "formatn" rules or they are not able to parse it).  In order to 
       retrieve the correctly formatted DateString value you need to use
       <em>$group.foo.StringValue</em> rather than <em>$group.foo.Value</em> 
       (you can do this for all values, not just DateString).
