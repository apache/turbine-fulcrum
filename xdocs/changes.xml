      	Added the Intake class which is a facade to the underlying IntakeService.
      </action>
      <action dev="epugh" type="fix">
       The intake validators were fixed so that fields with required=false 
       rules no longer attempt to execute the remaining rules when no
       input is provided.  A minLength > 0 rule is no longer synonymous
       with required=true.  Patch originally supplied by Colin Chalmers
