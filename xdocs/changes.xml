        Changed multiproject site build so that instead of having a
        /docs/multiproject/fulcrum-XXX url, it is /docs/fulcrum-XXX
        url for all the components.  Allows us to leverage the multiproject
        plugin better.  Updated docs on building the site.  Easier to update 
        individual component site documentation this way.

        Build process updated to use 'multiproject' plugin.  Additionally,
        significantly more components have been converted to being seperate
        Avalon components.

      <action dev="quintonm" type="add">
        The build process for Fulcrum has been changed.  Now, when you 
        build Fulcrum, it uses Maven's reactor to build the components
        individually.  This means that Fulcrum itself no longer has a 
        version number.  The individual components are versioned 
        seperately.  For changes to individual components, see the docs 
        for each component.
