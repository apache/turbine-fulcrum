      <action dev="quintonm" type="add">
        TestContainer component was added.  This is to be used for 
        testing of the components so that we do not have a dependancy
        on Plexus.  The test container is based on ECM, which is what
        Turbine is using.  A base class for unit tests is also included.

        XML-RPC component was added.

      <action dev="quintonm" type="add">
        The build process for Fulcrum has been changed.  Now, when you 
        build Fulcrum, it uses Maven's reactor to build the components
        individually.  This means that Fulcrum itself no longer has a 
        version number.  The individual components are versioned 
        seperately.  For changes to individual components, see the docs 
        for each component.

      <action dev="epugh" type="add">
	Added new HibernateService that uses Hibernate 2.0.  This is 
	a fully Avalonized service, and thus can be loaded by both 
	Plexus and ECM.  ECM is used in Turbine, Plexus is used in the 
	testcase.
