 <section name="What is Fulcrum?">
   <p>
     Fulcrum is a services framework.
   </p>
   <p>
     Fulcrum was developed as part of the Turbine Framework. It is now
     decoupled and can be used by itself. Starting with version 2.2 Turbine
     will be able to use the decoupled Fulcrum to replace some of the services
     that are currently coupled to Turbine.
