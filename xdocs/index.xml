      <p>
        The PBEService (Password Based Encryption Service) supports encryption
        and decryption of resources using JCA (Java Crypto Architecture)
        and JCE (Java Crpyto Extension) providing
        <ul>
          <li>method to create more or less secure passwords</li>
          <li>creation of cipher streams for transparent encryption/decryption</li>
          <li>generic encryption/decryption methods</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        The implementation uses PBEWithMD5AndTripleDES and was inspired
        by Pankaj Kumar and his excellent book
        <a href="http://www.j2ee-security.net/">J2EE Security</a>.
      </p>


      <p>
        The implementation depends directly on the YAAFI libraries since
        the actual implementation is found there.
